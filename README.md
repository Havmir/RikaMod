This version is 0.2.1-Beta

Changelog:

Changed RandomUSB to have the correct color, which involved updated en.json as well

Added Console.WriteLine for SpareStatus to help see what happened prior to getting crazy statuses

Cleaned up the code on HullLostManager

Blitz now has Console.WriteLine stuff

ArtManager can now manager a lot of Console.WriteLine things. If you want it disabled, you'd need to go to ArtManager and set _isplaytester to false. (Not sure how you would do that, but I'm looking into it.)

Every Rika artifact besides randomUSB now has Console.Writeline things
